    "\n",
    "CKY Parsing, named after its inventors, John Cocke, Daniel Younger, and Tadao Kasami, is a widely used algorithm for parsing sentences in context-free grammars. It stands out for its efficiency and capability to handle ambiguous grammatical structures, making it a fundamental tool in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactic parsing, the process of analyzing a sentence's structure according to the rules of a formal grammar, plays a critical role in understanding language. The CKY algorithm, with its bottom-up parsing approach, allows us to decompose complex sentences into their constituent parts, facilitating tasks like machine translation, sentiment analysis, and information extraction. By mastering CKY Parsing, you gain a deeper understanding of how computers interpret and process human language, a key skill in the field of NLP."

    "### What is a Syntax Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax tree, also known as a parse tree, is a tree representation of the syntactic structure of a sentence. In linguistics and NLP, these trees are crucial for understanding how different parts of a sentence relate to each other according to the rules of grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Syntax Trees in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax trees play a vital role in various NLP applications. They help in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding Sentence Structure:** By breaking down a sentence into its constituent parts, syntax trees make it easier to analyze the grammatical structure.\n",
    "- **Improving Language Models:** They are essential in developing more accurate models for tasks like machine translation, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "- **Information Extraction:** Syntax trees aid in extracting meaningful information from complex sentences, which is crucial in tasks like question answering and text summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task: Importing and Visualizing the Syntax Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to import a syntax tree from the provided file `train.trees.pre.unk` and visualize its structure. This exercise will enhance your understanding of how sentences are structured in NLP and the role of syntax trees in this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read the First Line of the File:** Use Python's built-in `open` function to access the file. Carefully read the first line of the file, which contains a sentence's syntax tree in a specific format. This can be done using the command `first_line = file.readline().strip()`. This command not only reads the line but also removes any leading or trailing whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parse the Syntax Tree:** With the line read from the file, you will parse it to create a syntax tree. Utilize the `Tree.fromstring(first_line)` method from NLTK, which converts the string representation into a Tree object. Store this object in a variable named `first_tree`.\n",

    "- A -> BC, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are non-terminal symbols, and 'B' and 'C' are not the start symbol.\n",

    "After extracting the productions from our CNF trees, the next vital step in our exercise is to induce a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) from these productions. This step is crucial in the realm of syntactic parsing in NLP.\n",

    "### What is a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) is an extension of the standard context-free grammar that associates probabilities with its production rules. In PCFG, each production rule is assigned a probability that signifies how frequently that rule is used to generate a sentence in a language. This probabilistic aspect allows us to model linguistic phenomena more realistically and handle ambiguities in natural language more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of PCFG in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, PCFGs are instrumental for several reasons:\n",
    "- **Handling Ambiguity:** They help in dealing with ambiguities inherent in natural languages by preferring more likely structures over less likely ones.\n",
    "- **Improving Parsing Accuracy:** PCFGs enhance the accuracy of parsing algorithms, making them more effective in understanding complex sentences.\n",
    "- **Application in Various NLP Tasks:** They are fundamental in tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, and syntactic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Induce a PCFG from Productions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Start Symbol:**\n",
    "   First, identify the start symbol for your grammar (go back to the tree visualization and check the start symbol). Create a nonterminal symbol using `nltk.Nonterminal` passing the start symbol as paremeter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Induce the PCFG:**\n",
    "    Utilize the `induce_pcfg` function from NLTK to create a PCFG grammer based on the start symbol and the list of **productions** you have previously extracted. Name it `grammar`.\n",
