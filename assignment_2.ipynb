To ensure successful grading, please follow these instructions carefully: Name your notebook as `assignment_2.ipynb` before submission, as CodeGrade requires this specific filename for grading purposes. Additionally, make sure there are no errors in your notebook, as CodeGrade will not be able to grade it if errors are present. Before submitting, we highly recommend restarting your kernel and running all cells again to ensure that there will be no errors when CodeGrade runs your script."

    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "For this assignment your objective is to utilize Scikit-learn functions, including constructing a data pipeline, to preprocess data for running a multiple linear regression model. We will create a machine learning model to predict apartment prices using the available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will follow steps outlined in the machine learning checklist provided in the textbook's appendix. It's important to acknowledge that this assignment is meant to stay at a simple, broad overview and in a real-world scenario, extensive data exploration, diverse data refinement techniques, experimentation with multiple models, and meticulous model refinement would be conducted before reaching the final evaluation stage. \n",

    "This assignment uses a dataset of advertised apartment rentals in the USA, and the original dataset can be found on [UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/555/apartment+for+rent+classified).  However, please use the dataset provided in Brightspace as some values have been changed and features deleted. The dataset provided through Brightspace contains 10,000 instances and 10 columns.\n",

Please restart your notebook's kernel and run your code from the beginning to ensure there are no error messages. Once you have verified that the code runs without any issues, submit your .ipynb notebook file to CodeGrade for evaluation. Your notebook should be called `assignment_2.ipynb`. You have unlimited attempts for this assignment.\n",
