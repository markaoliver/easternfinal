Presently, the data seems inadequate for effectively predicting apartment prices. However, it's worthwhile to proceed and attempt another machine learning algorithm to see if there are any improvements. \n",

It is necessary that we apply any data transformations we performed on the training data to the testing data.

It is essential that you use the transform method and refrain from using the fit_transform method on your testing data.\n",
    "2) With the pre-fitted `forest_reg` model, make predictions using the `X_test_prepared` dataset and store these predictions as a variable called `final_predictions`.\n",
    "3) Utilizing Scikit-learn's [mean_squared_error](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html) function, calculate the root mean squared error (RMSE) by passing your y_test and final_predictions, making sure to set the `squared` parameter to `False`.  Round the RMSE score to 2 decimal places. Save this score as `final_rmse`."
